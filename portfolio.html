        <p style="text-align:center;font-size:190%;">Here are some of the projects I worked on through the year. They 
        will be listed within chronological order. </p>
        <h2 style="text-align:center;font-size:250%;">Scratch Story (9/15/17)</h2>
        <p style="text-align:center;font-size:190%;">Within the process of making my game I learned that sprinting is when a group
        of coders come together to make something or rewrite a code. While doing the code I've learned that using 
        a lot of organization and communication with my partner is key to making the project come out successful. I
        first started the project by making the task list day by day to focus on specific things rather than doing 
        things in an unorderly fashion. This project helped me have a better understanding of the coding process.</p>
